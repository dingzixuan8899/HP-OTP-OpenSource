# HP-OTP-open_source
HP-OTP is a challenge-response OTP protocol that redefines 2FA security by integrating password hardening and device factor.  HP-OTP ensures OTPs explicitly prove possession of both the user’s password and device, preventing adversaries from bypassing 2FA even if the server or device is compromised.
